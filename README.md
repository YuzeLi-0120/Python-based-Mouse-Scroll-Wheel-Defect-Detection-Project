You can run the .ipynb program freely on your personal devices with all codes I've presented. To run it, you may need to download a Jupyter Notebook or add a module for .ipynb files in VS code, or if you feel complicate through these methods mentioned. You can just copy the code in the blocks and run it in a python 3 environment.
